  description: "I\u2019m a regular here, I\u2019m sure many of you will know me,
    or know of me\u2026 \r\nSince a teenager I had a love for dance, and as I went
    into adult life, It became more exotic. You could say I gained an infamous reputation
    for the art of the striptease. I\u2019ve travelled around the continents, working
    at many inns and dancing for many noble heroes. So\u2026 could I dance for you,
    noble hero? Tip me wisely and we can talk."
