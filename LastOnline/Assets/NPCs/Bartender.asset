  description: "Tired yet crystalline eyes stare out into the taverna. Methodically
    wiping clean the glass in his hands, his eyes graze over the space as he seems
    to be mentally taking note of all the various patrons. Agatone is the skilled
    bartender of Sadalsuud, and his years of experience have formed him into the
    best drink maker in all of Z\u014Didiak\xF2s. This, aided by his worship of Aquarius,
    endows him with enhanced mixologist skills, meaning every drink he hand-crafts
    is perfection. A man of the people, Agatone does not charge a higher rate for
    his beverage, but instead strictly ensures that none of his patrons have more
    than they can handle"
