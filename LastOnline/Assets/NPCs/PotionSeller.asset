  description: "Askelpios\u2019 rough appearance makes him not the most trustworthy
    of potion sellers\u2026 judging by the mad scientist appearance, it seems he
    makes most of his wares himself. A home brew potion definitely seems like a risky
    purchase, but with the greatly reduced price and puppy eyes he gives all potential
    clients, it seems lots of individuals have trouble denying him. Despite it all,
    he has never received a complaint! So his stuff must be legit! Unless\u2026 every
    customer hasn\u2019t survived long enough to do so.... "
