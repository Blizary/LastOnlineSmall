  description: "Will you join forces with me to fight the Constellations and their
    constant pitting of us against each other? Why on Z\u014Didiak\xF2s should we
    use these powers to fight each other? Why should we be limited to only one set
    of powers from one elemental group??? If we all join forces we can put a stop
    to this once and for all!"
