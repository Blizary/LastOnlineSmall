  description: "\u2018She peers at you from underneath her eyelashes with her ice-cold
    gaze, appraising you silently. She is of medium height and stature, yet there
    is a cold and foreboding air about her that you just can\u2019t shake. You can\u2019t
    tell whether she is to be trusted or avoided, and she has no intention of telling
    you what to do. Her hair cascades down her shoulders in perfectly formed princess
    curls, and although she wields a spear her snow white hands seem dainty. Just
    what is her story?\u2019 "
